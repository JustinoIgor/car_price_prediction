## Business Problem

The High Rotation Company works with the purchase and sale of cars and seeks
to stipulate with greater precision the value of used vehicles to facilitate
negotiations and identify the best opportunities.

Currently, the company calculates the price of the car by making an average
between vehicles of the same year and model, disregarding the other features.
The procedure used generates a high percentage error and a failure to identify
buy and sell opportunities.

The Company carries out negotiations immediately, naming this process as 
Easy Transactions, when it is able to stipulate a price with a percentage 
error of up to 5%.
The profit for Easy Transactions was calculated as 5% of the actual value
minus the error.

It was requested the delivery of a model that stipulates the value of the
vehicle, reducing the average percentage error, identifying the best 
opportunities and that is easily accessible.
In addition, a model performance report was requested containing the 
following information:

1. After analyzing the data, what were the main insights
2. The number of Easy Transactions that will be carried out
3. The total profit on Easy Transactions.
4. The error percentage value before and after model implementation
5. Additional profit after model implementation
6. The best and worst buying opportunities
